# Contributing to Ratings

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Ratings and Ubuntu! Itâ€™s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing this project. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

We take our community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this project via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both:

* Search for existing Issues and PRs on this repository before creating your own.
* We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but, depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause. A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can help draw attention if your issue is blocking.
* If you've never contributed before, see [this Ubuntu discourse post](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/contribute/26) for resources and tips on how to get started.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the software, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

### Pull Requests

PRs are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

* Only fix/add the functionality in question **OR** address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality.
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
* Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

> PRs will trigger unit and integration tests with and without race detection, linting and formatting validations, static and security checks, freshness of generated files verification. All the tests must pass before merging in main branch.

Once merged to the main branch, `po` files and any documentation change will be automatically updated. Those are thus not necessary in the pull request itself to minimize diff review.

## Contributing to the code

### Required dependencies

* rust and cargo >= 1.69
* protobuf-compiler >= 3.21
* docker >= 24.04
* docker-compose >= 2.18

### Setup on Ubuntu

```shell
# Install the Rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y --profile minimal
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

# Install build-time dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git gcc libssl-dev pkg-config
sudo snap install --classic protobuf

# (Optional) Install rockcraft for building the OCI image
sudo snap install rockcraft --classic --channel edge

# (Optional) Install Docker for running the OCI image
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o /tmp/get-docker.sh
sh /tmp/get-docker.sh
```

### Building and running the binaries

To build and run the binary during development:

```shell
# Setup a .env file
# You'll need to adjust the values in the resulting .env to point to a suitable PostgreSQL instance.
cp example.env .env

# Build and run
cargo run
```

To _just_ build the binary you can run `cargo build --release`. The result will be placed at
`./target/release/ratings`.

## Building and running the OCI image

The OCI image for Ratings is built using [`rockcraft`](https://github.com/canonical/rockcraft).

You can get started like so:

```shell
# Build the image
rockcraft --verbose

# Grab the version from the rockcraft.yaml
version="$(grep -Po "^version: \K.+" rockcraft.yaml)"

# Copy the image from the ROCK archive to the local docker daemon
sudo /snap/rockcraft/current/bin/skopeo \
    --insecure-policy \
    copy oci-archive:"ratings_${version}_amd64.rock" docker-daemon:"ratings:${version}"

# Run the service - replace the postgres var with valid database credentials
docker run --rm \
    -e POSTGRES="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ratings" \
    -e JWT_SECRET="deadbeef" \
    -p 18080:18080 \
    "ratings:${version}"
```

### About the testsuite

The project includes a comprehensive testsuite made of unit and integration tests. All the tests must pass before the review is considered. If you have troubles with the testsuite, feel free to mention it on your PR description.

Currently (but to be changed) this test suite makes use of `cargo-make` and `docker` to coordinate tests. 

To install these dependencies:

```
# Install cargo-make
cargo install cargo-make

# Install docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o /tmp/get-docker.sh
sh /tmp/get-docker.sh
```

Tests are located under the `tests/` folder and the coordination scripts are located in the `Makefile.toml` file.

These tests require a database to run against. The easiest way to set up the database, run the tests and clean up is via the following commands:

```
# Spin up and bootstrap a test db
cargo make db-up

# Run the tests
cargo make full-test

# To tear down the db
cargo make db-down

# Clean up docker images and build artifacts
cargo make full-clean

```

The test suite must pass before merging the PR to our main branch. Any new feature, change or fix must be covered by corresponding tests.

### Code style

This project follow the [rust style-guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/README.html).
