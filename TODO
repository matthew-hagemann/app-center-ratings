# Things we need to handle as part of the refactor

- [ ] update proto generation to output rust files to somewhere within /src (same as prompting client)
  - [ ] add the CI check from prompting that the generated code is up to date
- [ ] replace the cargo-make Makefile with a normal Makefile
- [ ] two docker compose files: one for running a locally built image and one running latest in the github registry
- [ ] rip out cucumber and simplify the integration tests
  - the test cases themselves are good but the cucumber wrappers are not needed
  - originally the tests were written without cucumber so lets look back in the git history to see if we can start
    from there
- [ ] rip out axum and the log-level / api version stuff
  - this will also include removing the axum wrapper around the tonic server
- [ ] replace the log crate with tracing
